# EmailNotifier
Logs in to an SMTPS server to send HTML emails to all emails in a CSV file.

I created this more for personal use with my blog's subscribers. I will not be changing anything on the main branch,
all commits/updates will occur on the GmailAPI Branch. The GmailAPI branch uses, as the name says, Gmail's API with Oauth2 as an
authentication method.
